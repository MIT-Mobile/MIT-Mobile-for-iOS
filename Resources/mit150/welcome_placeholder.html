        <h3>Welcome to MIT150</h3>
<p>Planning for MIT’s 150th anniversary began several years ago and is now guided by a steering committee  composed of faculty, students, and staff with related expertise or  responsibilities. Referring to the defined planning principles, the  committee is building a program to engage all facets of the MIT  community and to provide public access to the people and  innovations that make the Institute unique.</p>
<p>Please explore the <a href=\"http://mit150.mit.edu\">MIT150 website</a> to learn about the academic programs, events, and projects through which we will honor the past and envision the future of MIT. Major events include the opening of the MIT150 Exhibition at the MIT Museum, the MIT150 Symposia, the Next Century Convocation, the FAST Arts Festival, and the Open House. When the fully featured MIT150 website launches in January 2011, online visitors will have access to interviews, historical information, and conversation among MIT community members and friends. In addition to sharing your story in the Corridor, join in live chats with MIT faculty and others. We welcome  your suggestions for hosts.</p>
