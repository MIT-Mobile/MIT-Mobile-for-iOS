#Building the app

Sensitive information like API keys for Facebook and Twitter are kept within Common/Configuration/Secret.m. If the configuration file does not exist, a default 'Secret.m' will be created the when the app is built (using the 'Secret.m.in' template).

MIT Mobile for iPhone will build for the iPhone Simulator without any modifications. To build for a device, you'll need to change the `CFBundleIdentifier` in MIT_Mobile-Info.plist from `edu.mit.mitmobile` to your own app id.
